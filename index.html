                    <p>In the previous article we presented you the library we wrote in order to control motors. The last weeks we worked on radio transmitter/receiver. Now the library has been developed we can present it to you through this article.</p>

                    <h2>Motors</h2>
                    <p>The last time we introduced the different components that we have chosen to construct our drone. For this article we have received some pieces. Before assembling everything, we thought it could be more convenient to write the different libraries. The purpose of this article is to present the library that we have written in order to control the motors.</p>

                    <p>In the first article we explained the idea of our project. For the last time we have begun with concrete things, beginning by modeling the drone. With this second article we introduce the components we have chosen and the intended circuit.</p>

        			<h2>Beginning</h2>
                    <p>First, let us introduce ourselves. We are four French engineering students from EISTI school (École Internationale des Sciences du Traitement de l'Information). The courses of this school deal with mathematics and computer science. This year is the last of our curriculum and we joined the embedded computing specialization. Also, in order to become graduated we have to realize a final project.</p>
